# tuto-stats

Since it is crucial to my future success, especially in the fields that I have chosen, I have committed to mastering statistics. This is repository is thus a collection of my attempts and notes to understand statistics, from a high school level to a university level, from a variety of sources.

## Study plan
### High School Statistics Foundation
Topics
- descriptive status : mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation
- data visualisation : histograms, box plots, scatter plots
- probability basics : conditional probability, independence, Bayes' theorem

Coding Applications 
- __Basic Data Analysis Script__ : write a Python script that calculates the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation from a dataset
- __Data Visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn__ : take a dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) and plot histograms, box plots, and scatter plots
***
### Probability & Combinatorics
Topics
- permutations, combinations
- probability distributions : binomial, Poisson, normal
- expectation & variance of random variables
- Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem

Coding Applications
- __Monte Carlo Simulation__ : estimate the probability of an event using random sampling (e.g., estimate Ï€ by simulating random points in a unit square)
- __Dice Roll & Card Draw Simulation__ : simulate rolling dice and drawing cards, calculate empirical vs. theoretical probabilities
***
### University-Level Statistics
#### for Computer Science
Topics
- hypothesis testing : t-tests, chi-square tests
- regression analysis : linear, logistic regression
- Bayesian inference
- Markov Chains, Random Walks

Coding Applications
- __Statistical Testing in Python__ : use SciPy to run t-tests and chi-square tests on real datasets.
- __Simple Machine Learning__ : implement a basic linear regression model to predict housing prices or another simple dataset
- __Markov Chain Simulation__ : model a simple Markov process (e.g., a weather predictor that transitions between states

#### for Biology _to be designed_
