# tuto-stats

## Context 
I never took statistics in high school since I got accepted to university in 11th grade. My first statistics class was thus a half-semester long statistics course for biology, which wasn't enough of a foundation to fully master another course, also a half-semester long, but for computer science.

## Objective of this personal project
- gain the missing statistics foundation
- prepare for my masters 
- master statistics for professional use
