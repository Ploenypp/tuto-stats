# tuto-stats

## Context 
I never took statistics in high school since I got accepted to university in 11th grade. My first statistics class was thus a half-semester long statistics course for biology, which wasn't enough of a foundation to fully master another statistics course for computer science, also a half-semester long.

## Objectives of this personal project
- gain the missing statistics foundation
- prepare for and supplement my masters studies
- master statistics for professional use

## Topics to Cover

### Completed
- combinatorics : combinations and permutations
  
### Currently Working On
- Probability Distributions : Binomial distribution demonstration

### To Do (based on my bachelor's and master's programs)
- Probability Distributions
- Random Variables
- Statistical Inference
- Hypothesis Testing
- Markov Chains
- Random Walks
- Bayesian Statistics
- Stochastic Processes
- Deep Learning

## Repository Organization 
`main` : current working branch

`initial-cram` : incomplete work done during my bachelor's 3rd year upon which the work in `main` expands
